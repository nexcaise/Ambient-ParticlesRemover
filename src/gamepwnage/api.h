/**
 * @defgroup VirtualAssets VirtualAssets API
 *
 * @brief Hooks the Android AAssetManager to layer a virtual filesystem
 *        transparently on top of the real APK asset tree.
 *
 * ### How the hook works
 * The NDK's AAssetManager_open (and its internal siblings) is intercepted via
 * HookManager. Every asset path opened by the game passes through the
 * interceptor, which checks the virtual registry before forwarding to the
 * real AAssetManager zip reader.
 *
 * ### Interception order (highest to lowest priority)
 *  1. **Blocked** – path returns failure immediately; the game sees the file
 *     as non-existent even though it is in the APK.
 *  2. **Virtual entry** – data registered by AddFile / AddTextFile / LoadDir /
 *     ReplaceFile is served to the caller instead of the APK data.
 *  3. **Fall-through** – the call is forwarded to the real AAssetManager and
 *     the APK data is returned unmodified.
 *
 * ### Thread safety
 * All functions are thread-safe after init_virtual_assets() returns. Internal
 * state is protected by a mutex; concurrent calls from the render thread,
 * audio thread, or mod worker threads are safe.
 *
